# BlackJackGame
This project is a visual representation of the Black Jack game.
Welcome to the Blackjack Game project! This project is a simple implementation of the classic casino card game, Blackjack, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play
In this version of Blackjack, players are allowed to take any number of cards until they reach a total value of 21 or decide to stand. However, if the total value of their hand exceeds 21, they bust and lose the game.

The objective of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. If a player's total hand value equals 21 with just two cards (an Ace and a 10-value card), they achieve Blackjack and win instantly.

Clone this repository to your local machine.
